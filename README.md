# Drum Machine

Created as part of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/drum-machine).

## Functionality

This is the [Drum Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine) project, where I make a drum machine that plays sounds when you press or click the corresponding button.

## Thoughts

Tbd...

God bless.
